### Hi there, I'm Lukas!

I'm a Software Research Fellow at the Center for Computational Quantum physics at Flatiron institute, with a keen interest in Tensor Networks and programming.
My research focuses on the development of tensor network techniques to study complex quantum systems, for example in the context of quantum information theory and condensed matter physics.

### What I'm currently working on
- Contributing to the [ITensors.jl](https://github.com/ITensor/ITensors.jl) ecosystem.
- Incorporating automatic differentiation for tensor network algorithms
- Writing a convenient library for symbolic algebra for quantum many body operators
- Maintaining [QuantumKitHub](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub) and its software stack. Check out [MPSKit.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/MPSKit.jl) and [PEPSKit.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/PEPSKit.jl) in particular.
- Contributing to various open-source projects related to Julia and Tensor Networks
