### Hi there, I'm Lukas!

I'm a Physics PhD student with a keen interest in Tensor Networks and programming.
My research focuses on the development of tensor network techniques to study complex quantum systems, for example in the context of quantum information theory and condensed matter physics.

### What I'm currently working on
- Incorporating automatic differentiation for tensor network algorithms
- Contributing to various open-source projects related to Julia and Tensor Networks
- Creating a MatLab tensor network library
